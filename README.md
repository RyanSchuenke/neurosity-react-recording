# Notion React Recording

Based off of the "Notion React Starter" available [here](https://github.com/neurosity/neurosity-react-web-starter)

Allows for the recording and saving of raw EEG data, the probability of being focused, and the probability of being calm over a duration of time to csv files.
Specifically designed for use in ADHD BCI research to determine the effects of body doubling on a person's calmness and focus.
